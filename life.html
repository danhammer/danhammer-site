    Outrigger Canoes 
  </a>
</h2>

<p> Outrigger canoes are functioning artifacts of South Pacific
heritage. The boats, once used for fishing and voyaging, are now built
to race: the sport has reached global dimensions, placing a newfound
pressure on canoe design. There is now a foreign demand for sleeker
and lighter boats -- crafted for racing, not fishing. But by altering
the designs, traditional builders risk losing a direct tie to their
heritage. In 2008, I was a Watson Fellow that apprenticed with the
local
craftsmen, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXFQA2_vBKs&list=WLAE5A3045DEABF5E9">
raced the boats they built</a>, and learned how they are addressing
the changing character of canoe culture.

    Dragonboat 
  </a>
</h2>

<p> Dragon boat racing is one of the earliest known forms of boat
racing and is celebrated at festivals and races throughout the
world. This mythical celebration is a symbol of Chinese culture and
spirit and is one of the three largest festivals in China. The roots
of dragon boat racing go back over 2,000 years to the southern
provinces of China.  I was part of the crews that took gold at the
World Championships in Qing Pu, China (2003); Sydney, Australia
(2007); and Prague, Czech Republic (2009).  I was part of the crew
that still holds
the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8MJUmT6jFQ">world record
for the 500m distance</a>, set in Sydney.

    Texas Water Safari 
  </a>
</h2>

<p> The Texas Water Safari, billed as the <i>World's Toughest Boat
Race</i>, is an annual race on the San Marcos and Guadalupe rivers,
from San Marcos to Seadrift, Texas, for a total distance of 260 miles.
In 2011, I was part of the six-person unlimited crew that won the
race, pictured below.  It took 39 hours and 51 minutes, constant
paddling, no breaks.  I thought I died.  Twice. It was miserable.

<p> From Wikipedia: Speedcubing (also known as speedsolving or
speed-cubing) is the activity of solving a Rubik's Cube or related
puzzle as quickly as possible. Here, solving is defined as performing
a series of moves that transforms a scrambled cube into a state where
each of the cube's six faces is one single, solid color.  I am a
