    Outrigger Canoes 
  </a>
</h2>

<p> Outrigger canoes are functioning artifacts of South Pacific
heritage. The boats, once used for fishing and voyaging, are now built
to race: the sport has reached global dimensions, placing a newfound
pressure on canoe design. There is now a foreign demand for sleeker
and lighter boats -- crafted for racing, not fishing. But by altering
the designs, traditional builders risk losing a direct tie to their
heritage. In 2008, I was a Watson Fellow that apprenticed with the
local craftsmen, raced the boats they built, and learned how they are
addressing the changing character of canoe culture.

    Texas Water Safari 
  </a>
</h2>

<p> The Texas Water Safari, billed as the <i>World's Toughest Boat
Race</i>, is an annual race on the San Marcos and Guadalupe rivers,
from San Marcos to Seadrift, Texas, for a total distance of 260 miles.
In 2011, I was part of the six-person unlimited crew that won the
race, pictured below.  It took 38 hours.  I thought I died.  Twice. It
was miserable.
