    Optimal development of resource pools
  </a>
</h2>

<p> I am slowly and steadily reading everything
that <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/publications">Weitzman</a>
has ever written.  Weitzman writes theory, not empirical papers.  I
use satellite imagery and other sources of <i>big data</i> to examine
the spatiotemporal development of resource clusters.  Specifically,
and most recently, I estimate the impact of the 2011 Indonesian
moratorium on new forest concessions for agriculture production. The
intended impact was to reduce the rate of deforestation, but instead I
find that the aggregate rate of deforestation increased as a direct
result of the policy.</p>

    Information theory in Clojure

</h2>

<p> I work with George Judge to apply his application of permutation
entropy to economic time series.  Below, we've calculated the
normalized permutation entropy for each 365 day block, offset by one
day, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average between May 26, 1896 and
March 4, 2013 for a total of 29,253 observations.  Historical shifts
in financial policy are clear, such as turmoil during the Great
Depression and the Reagan deregulation.</p>

<p> I was the Graduate Student Instructor
for <a href="http://are.berkeley.edu/~auffhammer/Maximilian_Auffhammer/Welcome.html">Max
Auffhammer</a>'s graduate-level econometrics class in Spring 2013.  I
wrote an open source repository for the section notes.</p>

    Break detection through space and time
  </a>
</h2>

<p>A critical component of the forest monitoring algorithm is
identifying breaks in time series data. We extend this variety of
break detection for spatiotemporal
data.  <a href="http://danhammer.github.io/forma-js/">This
presentation</a>, given at Clojure/West, describes the algorithm for
mapping a function across partitions to identify structural shifts in
time series.</p>
