    Optimal development of resource pools
  </a>
</h2>

<p> I am slowly and steadily reading everything
that <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/publications">Weitzman</a>
has ever written.  Weitzman writes theory, not empirical papers.  I
use satellite imagery and other sources of <i>big data</i> to examine
the spatiotemporal development of resource clusters.  Specifically,
and most recently, I estimate the impact of the 2011 Indonesian
moratorium on new forest concessions for agriculture production. The
intended impact was to reduce the rate of deforestation, but instead I
find that the aggregate rate of deforestation increased as a direct
result of the policy.</p>

    Barriers to entry for online information
  </a>
</h2>

<p> The market for online content is highly competitive.  Consumers now move
freely across websites with virtually zero transaction costs.  And, in fact,
Internet users have come to <i>expect</i> zero-cost interactions.  <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-
slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">Recent studies</a> have shown
that even nominal load times, only 400 milliseconds, are enough to drive users
away from websites.  Load time alone is a substantial cost to users, but it is
just one component of multifaceted <a href="http://ebusiness.mit.edu/research/
papers/2011.06_Lambrecht_Tucker_Paying%20with%20Money%20or%20with%20Effort_310
.pdf">hassle costs</a> which also include search
costs and the mental overhead to engage with new content.  What is the impact
on website usage when marginal barriers are introduced before the content?  Is
the time to engage the only barrier, or are other factors just as
important?</p>

    Information theory in Clojure 
  </a>
</h2>

<p> I work
with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Theoretic-Approach-Econometrics/dp/0521689732">George
Judge</a> to apply his application of permutation entropy to economic
time series.  Below, we've calculated the normalized permutation
entropy for each 365 day block, offset by one day, for the Dow Jones
Industrial Average between May 26, 1896 and March 4, 2013 for a total
of 29,253 observations.  Historical shifts in financial policy are
clear, such as turmoil during the Great Depression and the Reagan
deregulation.</p>

    Computer vision applied to satellite imagery
  </a>
</h2>

<p>Traditional remote sensing methods tend to focus on spectral
characteristics of individual pixels.  These methods are well-suited for
moderate resolution imagery.  However, now, commercial satellite imagery
providers are able to serve out imagery on a regular basis at 25cm resolution.
The higher resolution allows for more advanced methods in computer vision to
be applied in full force to satellite imagery.  These methods leverage
information on the spatial structure of nearby pixels, not just the coloration
within a pixel. Applications range from counting cars in parking lots to
monitoring the growth of refugee camps.</p>

<p> I was the Graduate Student Instructor

Auffhammer</a>'s graduate-level econometrics class in Spring 2013.  I

    Break detection through space and time
  </a>
</h2>

<p>A critical component of the forest monitoring algorithm is
identifying breaks in time series data. We extend this variety of
break detection for spatiotemporal
data.  <a href="http://danhammer.github.io/forma-js/">This
presentation</a>, given at Clojure/West, describes the algorithm for
mapping a function across partitions to identify structural shifts in
time series.</p>
