I will have the opportunity to learn about the way data science is used at
both the White House and NASA as a Presidential Innovation Fellow.  I will
report here and on twitter
[@econohammer](https://twitter.com/econohammer). Sporadically.  No,
actually continuously.  I am going to blog, like, all the time.  This I
promise myself.  All views are my own.

With that, here are the online resources I found in advance of the
appointment:

- [White House site](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows). The
  flagship site for the fellowship at
  [whitehouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows). The GitHub
  organization for the Presidential Innovation Fellows.  It's cool that this
  exists.
- [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Innovation_Fellows).
  Includes a compendium of former projects and fellows.
- [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov). The website for the encompassing organization
  that seems to be mainly comprised of former fellows.
- [US Digital Services Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/). The USDS best
  practices from the private sector and government that, if followed together,
  will help government build effective digital services.
  
Ha! Well, actually there are (justifiable) restrictions about what I can blog
about.  This makes sense.  I will attempt to blog.  If I can.  More soon.
