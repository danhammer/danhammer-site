title: "An API for Officer Involved Shootings"
---

The anger after the officer involved shooting (OIS) incidents in Ferguson and many other cities in the United States is well-justified.  A hard and personal question is **why** these shootings occur.  A much easier (or at least a more manageable) question is **how many** officer involved shootings occur in the US. Is the recent attention due to an increase in shootings, or just more public awareness?  I couldn't find basic statistics on police shootings.  This seems wrong.

I was only able to find official statistics from the [Dallas](http://www.dallaspolice.net/ois/ois.html) and [Philadelphia](http://www.phillypolice.com/ois) police departments.  Here is a visualization of of the Dallas data.  This department should be commended for their efforts toward public accountability, even though the statistics are troubling.  Why are there so many officer involved shootings?  **Zoom and click on the points for details on the shooting.**

The [CartoDB](http://www.cartodb.com) map comes with a built-in API, based on SQL queries.  You can access the data in a structured way with the following query:

{% highlight bash %}
http://nasahammer.cartodb.com/api/v2/sql?q=SELECT * FROM public.dallas_shootings
{% endhighlight %}

This data is being incorporated into a more comprehensive database, which also includes media reports of OIS incidents. This service rides on elasticsearch, so the database is searchable and scalable. 

{% highlight bash %}
http://ois-incidents.appspot.com/content?limit=10&query=airsoft
{% endhighlight %}


{% highlight javascript %}

    count: 6,
    results: [
        {

            victim_gender: "male",
            outcome: "killed",
            summary: "The Deputy's encounter with Andy Lopez occurred in an
            open field. The boy's Airsoft replica AK 47 and a replica pistol
            looked realistic because not marked with orange tip.",
            officer_names: "Eric Gelhaus"
        },
        ...
    ]

Another field will ultimately be added for report type, either **official** or **unofficial**.  The unofficial reports are powerful for two reasons.  First, they apply pressure to police departments nationwide to release official statistics.  The information will be publicly available, whether the police departments like it or not.  They should want to ensure that the information is a true reflection of the events, rather than filtered through a media machine.  Second, the reports are striking.  It is incredibly troubling to read through the aggregated reports.  This sort of transparency is steeped in history.  [Ida Wells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_B._Wells) simply reported the disgusting frequency of lynchings in the South in the late nineteenth century.  Just seeing the numbers on lynchings created a movement to stop them.  Hopefully people will contribute to the [open-source repository](https://github.com/danhammer/ois-incidents) to continuously scrape the various sources of this information and serve them back out in a structured, reliable way.
