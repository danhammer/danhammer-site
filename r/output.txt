#FunWithDelphi: NASA API Mashup
https://community.embarcadero.com/competitions/14-fun-with-delphi-nasa-api-mash-up
You can have a little fun with Delphi and C++Builder in the new year by entering into our #FunWithDelphi contest! Delphi makes it fast and easy to build REST clients using powerful built in components like TRESTClient and TRESTResponseDataSetAdapter. You can easily load up the JSON data retrieved from a REST API into in-memory components like TFDMemTable. Finally, you can use LiveBindings to visually display the data in your apps with very little code required. 
We are excited to see what creative ways the Delphi and C++Builder community can come up with to utilize the REST libraries so we are announcing a contest where you can showcase your best REST client mashup using the NASA API. Shout out to Asbjørn Heid for the contest idea! Disclaimer: This contest is not sponsored or approved by NASA."
