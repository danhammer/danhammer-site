    Environmental Web Services as a Public Service
  </a>
</h2>

<p> The return on investment for natural capital is not purely financial.  There are social and non-market benefits that accrue to nature.  For example, the benefits of wetlands as a common resource for water filtering cannot be fully captured through market transactions.  The benefits of clean air for public health have social benefits that cannot be captured by those that invest in its cleanliness.  The result is that the natural environment is under-valued by the free market.  So too is the enabling data infrastructure that provisions environmental information.  Web service APIs are the building blocks for modern applications.  What is the appropriate role of the public sector to build or maintain web service APIs for environmental data in order to enable the private sector use of environmental information?

    The Earth Genome
  </a>
</h2>

<p>The Earth Genome is working to build a platform to enable easy-to-use, inexpensive, scientifically credible, continuously updated global information on natural resources.  This infrastructure is coupled with powerful and relevant decision-support tools. The platform and tools will exponentially lower the cost and time to analyze data and translate it into insights that decision makers can use.  I am a cofounder along with Glen Low and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McCormick_(executive)">Steve McCormick</a>, who is an environmental hero.  The Earth Genome has initially focused on water and agriculture, with simple web applications to easily monitor change in natural resources.

<p> The Presidential Innovation Fellows program is a competitive fellowship
program that pairs top innovators from the private sector, non-profits, and
academia with top innovators in government.  I'm working with NASA,
specifically the Office of the CTO, on open data and open innovation.  I'll do
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data science</a> to
support President Obama's mandate to "harness new ideas and technology to
remake our government." I'll <a href="http://www.danham.me/r/posts.html">blog
about the experience</a> and I guess more generally data science at the White
House and NASA.  This is a <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/healthcare-

relationship to the US Digital Service (which is different). </p>

    SpaceNinja
  </a>
</h2>

<p>There are massive volumes of earth imagery available from commercial satellites.  If you had all the imagery in the world, where would you look?  Why would you look there?  I co-founded SpaceNinja to try to answer these questions by organizing change detected from high-resolution satellite imagery.  The algorithms rely on a new branch of machine learning, called deep learning; and we apply these new techniques to stacks of satellite images.

<p> NASA collects well over 20TB of data every day as of 2015.  The objective
of <a href="http://data.nasa.gov">api.nasa.gov</a> is to expose that data in a way that internal and external researchers can easily leverage.  To seed this project, I've built APIs to serve out <a href="api.data.gov/nasa/planetary/mars?rover=msl&instrument=mastcam_left&api_key=DEMO_KEY">mars imagery</a>, the <a href="https://api.data.gov/nasa/planetary/apod?concept_tags=True&api_key=DEMO_KEY">APOD data</a>, <a href="https://api.data.gov/nasa/planetary/earth?lon=100.75&lat=1.5&size=medium&begin=2014-07-01&end=2014-09-01&api_key=DEMO_KEY">earth imagery</a>, <a href="api.data.gov/nasa/patents/content?query=temperature&limit=5&api_key=DEMO_KEY">patent information</a>, and <a href="">space sounds</a>. Ultimately, the catalog of APIs will help to standardize documentation and, hopefully, offer a style guide for future NASA APIs.  As a Presidential Innovation Fellow, I wrote APIs and helped to design strategy for institutional API design.</p>

    Officer Involved Shootings API
  </a>
</h2>

<p> How many officer involved shooting (OIS) incidents occur each year?  When
officers are shot, the data are emminently accessible.  When a public citizen
is shot, however, the data are less accessible.  This seems wrong.  Not just
for the public, but for conscientious officers who care about effective and
sustainable law enforcement.  There are many, disparate projects that collect
unofficial accounts of OIS incidents, mostly from the news media.  A few
commendable police departments are releasing official accounts.  This project
is an attempt to structure and serve out the available data, both official and
unofficial, in a standard and reliable way. See <a
href="http://www.danham.me/r/2015/01/02/ois-api.html">this post</a> for the
endpoints.</p>

<p> <a href="http:www.spaceknow.com">SpaceKnow</a> is a San Francisco based
start-up that monitors economic activity from satellite imagery.  Traditional
remote sensing relies mainly on spectral image analysis.  The availability of
high-resolution imagery from providers like Digital Globe or Planet Labs has
created new opportunities to monitor human behavior using computer vision and
feature detection, which are new to earth observation but well-established in
companies like Facebook or Instagram. </p>
