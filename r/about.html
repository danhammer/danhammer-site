    Dan Hammer is a PhD Candidate at UC Berkeley, studying
    environmental economics and information theory.  He graduated from
    Swarthmore College with high honors in mathematics and economics,
    and passed the mandatory swim test with the grace of a cuttlefish.
    Dan does not like self-introductions, especially those written in
    the third-person, so I am writing it for him.  My name is Murray.
    And I am a human with a square jaw and strong features.  [<i>Hold
    it together, Murray, this isn't about you.</i>] Fine.  Dan Hammer
    is the co-creator of
    the <a href="http://www.reddmetrics.com/forma-clj">FORMA
    algorithm</a> to detect forest clearing activity, which serves as
    a basis data set for the <a href="http://www.wri.org/gfw2">Global
    Forest Watch</a> initiative.  He is now a Research Fellow and the
    Chief Data Scientist at the
    <a href="http://www.wri.org">World Resources Institute</a> where
    he works with a team that brings coding cool to a warming planet.
    This is Murray, signing off.
