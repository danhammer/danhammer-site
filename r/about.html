Chief Data Scientist at <a href="http://www.earthgenome.org">The Earth

with high honors in mathematics and economics, and passed the <a
href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/new- students/requirements-0#D">mandatory swim
test</a> with the grace of a cuttlefish. Dan does not like self-introductions,
especially those written in the third-person, so I am writing it for him. My
name is Murray. And I am a human with a square jaw and strong features.
[<i>Hold it together, Murray, this isn't about you.</i>] Fine.  Dan Hammer was
a co-founder at <a href="http://www.space.ninja">SpaceNinja</a>, a start-up
that derives actionable insight from commercial satellite imagery -- whatever
that means. He is the co-creator of the <a
href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243414000956">
FORMA algorithm</a> to detect forest clearing activity, which serves as a
basis data set for the <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org">Global
Forest Watch</a> initiative.  He recently left the position of Chief Data
Scientist at the <a href="http://www.wri.org">World Resources Institute</a>

bring coding cool to a warming planet. This is Murray, signing off.
