    <b>Dan Hammer</b> <a href="/r/cv.pdf">[CV]</a> is a <a
    href="www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows">Presidential Innovation
    Fellow</a>, on leave from a PhD program at UC Berkeley.  He graduated from
    Swarthmore College with high honors in mathematics and economics, and
    passed the <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/new-students/requirements-0#D">mandatory swim test</a> with the grace of a
    cuttlefish. Dan does not like self- introductions, especially those
    written in the third- person, so I am writing it for him. My name is
    Murray. And I am a human with a square jaw and strong features. [<i>Hold
    it together, Murray, this isn't about you.</i>] Fine.  Dan Hammer is a co-
    founder at <a href="http://www.spaceknow.com">SpaceKnow</a>, a start-up
    that derives actionable insight from commercial satellite imagery -
    whatever that means.  He is the co-creator of the <a
    href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303243414000956">
    FORMA algorithm</a> to detect forest clearing activity, which serves as a
    basis data set for the <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org">Global
    Forest Watch</a> initiative.  He recently left the position of Chief Data
    Scientist at the <a href="http://www.wri.org">World Resources
    Institute</a> where he worked with the <a
    href="http://datalab.wri.org">Data Lab</a> to bring coding cool to a
    warming planet. And now, he is working with the NASA CTO office on their
    open innovation initiative, representing the Obama Administration's
    Presidential Innovation initiative. This is Murray, signing off.
