    <b>Dan Hammer</b> <a href="/r/cv.pdf">[CV]</a> is the winner of the 2017 Pritzker Prize for the Environment, and a co-founder at <a href="http://www.earthrise.media">Earthrise</a>.  He earned a PhD from UC Berkeley in the <a href="https://are.berkeley.edu">Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics</a>, and was a <a
href="http://bids.berkeley.edu/people/dan-hammer">Fellow</a> at the <a
href="http://bids.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Institute of Data Science</a>; and he earned the 2019 <a href="https://awards.berkeley.edu/achievement-awards/mark-bingham/recipients">Mark Bingham Award for Excellence in Achievement by a Young Alumnus</a>.  Dan was a Senior Policy Advisor in the Obama White House; the Lead Data Scientist for the <a

with high honors in mathematics and economics, and passed the <a
href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/new-students/requirements-0#D">mandatory swim
test</a> with the grace of a cuttlefish. Dan does not like self-introductions,
especially those written in the third-person, so I am writing it for him. My
name is Murray. And I am a human with a square jaw and strong features.
[<i>Hold it together, Murray, this isn't about you.</i>] Fine.  Dan Hammer was
a co-founder at <a href="http://www.spaceknow.com">SpaceKnow</a> which has seen some success, and <a href="http://www.space.ninja">SpaceNinja</a> which has not.  Dan was the Chief Data Scientist at the World Resources Institute and the co-founder of <a href="http://www.globalforestwatch.org">Global
Forest Watch</a>. This is Murray, signing off.
