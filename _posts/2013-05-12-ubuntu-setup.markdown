title: "Ubuntu set up"
---

I use OSX to consume content and Linux to create content.  Or, rather,
my wife screws up my Netflix preferences on OSX and I spend too much
time fucking with syntax highlighting on Ubuntu.  I recently bought a
new Macbook Pro, and I've documented the steps to set up Ubuntu on a
virtual machine.  I'll save this image so that I don't actually have
to go through these steps again; but it may be useful as a script, of
sorts, so I laid it out as a separate post.
